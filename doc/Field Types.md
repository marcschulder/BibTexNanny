# Field Types

_The following information is taken from the [Wikipedia BibTex article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)._

A BibTeX entry can contain various types of fields. The following types are recognized by the default bibliography styles; some third-party styles may accept additional ones:


### address

Publisher's address (usually just the city, but can be the full address for lesser-known publishers)


### annote

An annotation for annotated bibliography styles (not typical)


### author

The name(s) of the author(s) (in the case of more than one author, separated byÂ and)


### booktitle

The title of the book, if only part of it is being cited


### chapter

The chapter number


### crossref

The key of the cross-referenced entry


### edition

The edition of a book, long form (such as "First" or "Second")


### editor

The name(s) of the editor(s)


### howpublished

How it was published, if the publishing method is nonstandard


### institution

The institution that was involved in the publishing, but not necessarily the publisher


### journal

The journal or magazine the work was published in


### key

A hidden field used for specifying or overriding the alphabetical order of entries (when the "author" and "editor" fields are missing). Note that this is very different from the key (mentioned just after this list) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry.


### month

The month of publication (or, if unpublished, the month of creation)


### note

Miscellaneous extra information


### number

The "(issue) number" of a journal, magazine, or tech-report, if applicable. (Most publications have a "volume", but no "number" field.)


### organization

The conference sponsor


### pages

Page numbers, separated either by commas or double-hyphens.


### publisher

The publisher's name


### school

The school where the thesis was written


### series

The series of books the book was published in (e.g. "[The Hardy Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys)" or "[Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science)")


### title

The title of the work


### type

The field overriding the default type of publication (e.g. "Research Note" for techreport, "{PhD} dissertation" for phdthesis, "Section" for inbook/incollection)


### volume

The volume of a journal or multi-volume book


### year

The year of publication (or, if unpublished, the year of creation)

In addition, each entry contains a key (Bibtexkey) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry. This key is the first item in a BibTeX entry, and is not part of any field.
