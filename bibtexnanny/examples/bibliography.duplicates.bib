It is the other way round: this paper tries to approximate such direct vector representation by a composition of vector representations drawn from head and modifier of the compound. Why is that meaningsful: most compounds are very rare, so computing a vector representation from the compound directly from its occurrences in a corpus is not possible; however, it is possible to find sufficient occurences in a corpus of the head and the modifier of the compound. The gold standard in this paper are vector representations of frequent compounds that have been directly estimated on the occurrences of the compounds itself in a corpus. INTERESTING & IMPOTRANT: in Section 1, there are some statistics regarding the distribution of German compounds. Compounds, in general, are quite common, but each individual compound does not occur very often.},
